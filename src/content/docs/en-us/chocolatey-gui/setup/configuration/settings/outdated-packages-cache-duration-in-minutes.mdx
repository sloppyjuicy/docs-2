In an attempt to be as efficient as possible, Chocolatey GUI caches the information about which of the installed
packages are currently outdated.  Instead of running the `choco outdated` command every time that information is
requested, the information is instead fetched from the local cache.  The length of time that the outdated packages
information is kept can be controlled via this configuration parameter.  The default is 60 minutes, which can be
increased as required.

<Callout type="info">
    Any time a package operation is completed, i.e. install/uninstall/upgrade, the outdated package information cache will be invalidated.
</Callout>
