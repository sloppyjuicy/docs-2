## Issue

In the nuspec, the Package Maintainers (`owners`) and Software Authors (`authors`) fields are the same names, indicating that the same people or organization are responsible for both the package, and the software.

## Recommended Solution

If the Package Maintainers and Software Authors are not the same people / organization, please update the `owners` and / or the `authors` field to the correct names.
If the package is provided by the same peple or organization that provides the software, there is nothing that needs to be updated.

## Reasoning

Chocolatey packages are typically created and maintained by Chocolatey Community Members, rather than Software Authors.
Due to this, and to avoid the wrong metadata being published on the Chocolatey Community Repository, such packages are flagged at all times.
