## Issue

In the nuspec, the `<id>` field has been specified with an underscore (`_`) as part of the package identifier when separating words.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the `<id>` field in the `.nuspec` file to ensure that the package identifier does not contain an underscore, and follows our [package naming Guidelines](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages/#naming-your-package)

## Reasoning

Packages on Chocolatey Community Repository should follow package guidelines and established conventions.
One of the established conventions is to separate different words using a dash (`-`) instead of an underscore (`_`).
