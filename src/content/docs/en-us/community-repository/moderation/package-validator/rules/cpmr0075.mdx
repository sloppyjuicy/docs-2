## Issue

Within one or more of the automation scripts, one or more URLs were found to point to a GitHub comment file or asset.
URLs starting with `https://github.com/<REPOSITORY_OWNER>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>/files/` or `https://github.com/<REPOSITORY_OWNER>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>/assets/` are considered to be GitHub comment URLs, both on the `github.com` and `gist.github.com` domains.

## Recommended Solution

Use the official download location of files from the software authors that are not part of a GitHub comment.
This can be URLs on their official web page, from their GitHub releases, or from a third party that is officially endorsed by the software developers.

## Reasoning

Since any user can upload files to a GitHub comment, even without publishing the comment, this can be used as an attack vector by malicious actors.
To prevent such misuse from happening and affecting our users, it has been decided to disallow these types of URLs.
