## Issue

In the nuspec, the tag `notSilent` has been specified, indicating that the package is not silent, which means that there is some indication that an install, upgrade or uninstall is taking place such as a window being shown, a progress bar or something else that is visible. 

A package not specifying this tag indicates it is entirely silent in all scenarios that are known.

## Recommended Solution

If the installation, upgrade or uninstall of the package is silent, please update the nuspec to not contain the `notSilent` tag, which means there is some indication that an install, upgrade or uninstall is taking place such as a window being shown, a progress bar or something else that is visible. 

## Reasoning

The tag `notSilent` should only be used to indicate that the package is not silent.
