## Issue

The `<id>` field in the package `.nuspec` file, contains a prerelease version name such as `alpha`, `beta`, etc.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the `<id>` field in the `.nuspec` file to ensure it only contains the name. The prerelease version name should be added to the `<version>` field. Prerelease packages can be [installed](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/install#options-and-switches) or [upgraded](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/upgrade#options-and-switches) using the `--pre` option in Chocolatey CLI.
